# Naming Script for Adobe Illustrator

This script takes all the layers and renames them to a convention like this: "1 LayerName," "2 LayerName," and so on, starting from the lowest layer and going to the highest. The purpose of this script is to facilitate better usage with MOHO animation software.

**How to use:**
1. Download script [ *illustrator.jsx* ]  onto your computer
2. Put it in a separate folder
3. Open Adobe Illustrator
4. Click on *File* in top left corner
5. Then click on *Scripts* and click *Other Scripts* 
6. From the opened window, navigate to folder with the script that you downloaded in step 1
7. Click *Open*
8. Script will automatically run and rename all your layers

### PS. Make shure all your layers are visible, before running the script
